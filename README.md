# Macanum_Wheel_Project
This project focuses on the design and motion control of a Mecanum wheel system, enabling 360-degree movement and omnidirectional motion. The system leverages the unique capabilities of Mecanum wheels to achieve smooth and precise movement in any direction, making it ideal for robotics and automation applications.

**Component used**  

1. **ESP32 Microcontroller** - Used to process input commands and control motor drivers.  
2. **Motor Drivers** - For controlling the motors based on commands from the ESP32.  
3. **Web Interface** - Used to send control commands to the ESP32.  
4. **Mecanum Wheels** - For enabling high maneuverability of the system.  
5. **Motors** - Assumed as part of the system to drive the Mecanum wheels.
